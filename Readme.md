Waterfall Model (SDLC) Software Development Life Cycle

Requirements => (P M ) Project Manager
1.Design => Senior Engineer or (EM) Engineer Manager
2.Development => SDE1,SDE2
3.Testing => SDET Software Development Engineer Testing
4.Deployment => Developer,DevOps
5.Maintainance => Build More Features

<!-- Monolith vs Microservices -->

Monolith means One Big Single Project
Backend
DB Connections
Frontend
Auth
Emails
Analytics

MicroServices means Small Projects Separated by Individual
Example Fare in Uber Detection ,Fraud Detection,Mananging Only Invoices and Biling,etc

Development Speed is more in Microservice than monolith.
Code Repository : Single in Monolith and Multiple in Micro-Service.
Scalaibilty : Monolith is Difficult than Microservice scability is easily by individual service.
deployment : Tuff in Monolith but microservice is easy : Mismatched is Problematic in microservice. Small Changes easily doable.
Tech Stack : In Monolith Fixed Tech stack. Not in MicroService
Infrastructure Cost : Lower in Monolith and Higher in MicroService
Complexity : Complexity Increase in Monolith than MicroService
Faulty Isolation : Crash More in Monolith than Microservice
Test Case : In Monolith End end is hard in MicroService than Monolith.
Ownership : Different take teams
Maintainance : easy in microservice
Rewamps :  
Debugging : Blame Game ,
DEv Experiences :

Two Microservices in Dev Tinder :
Backend
Frontend
Communicate via API
